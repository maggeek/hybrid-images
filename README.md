The program is creating hybrid images from a given set of pairs of images.

To run the program, you need to:
1. Unzip the folder into your chosen directory.
2. Run main.py from your console.
3. Choose the pair to make a hybrid image from. There is 7 such pairs and you are able to choose one with every run of the program.
4. All needed files and images are attached in the same folder, so you don't need to worry about anything else
5. Let the program take its time. In some cases it might take a few minutes.
6. The hybrid image is going to be saved in the same directory. Its name is hybrid.png

The parameters for Gaussian kernels are set in the program for each pair of images to make sure the best result is achieved.
However, you can change the parameters to experiment in parameters.py. Simply edit the file with your text editor. Please
be aware that if your kernel size is going to be larger than 30 in one dimension, program will run for a long time.
